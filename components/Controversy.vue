            Both Drake and Kendrick Lamar have consistently accused each other of illegal activity and overall misconduct.
            <br />
            <br />
            Kendrick Lamar acted on existing rumors of Drake being a pedophile throughout his disses. These rumors primarily stemmed from Drake&apos;s publicly scrutinized relationship with Millie Bobby Brown, which most considered to have been grooming. Many of Drake&apos;s colleagues and friends
            are also convicted sex offenders, which Lamar mentions in “Meet the Grahams.” Additionally, evidence of Drake having intimate relationships with seventeen-year-olds has been going around, amongst many fake AI-generated clips of the same manner.

            On the other hand, Drake has accused Kendrick Lamar of sexually abusing his partner, Whitney Alford. These rumors did exist earlier, but were quickly shut down as there was little supporting evidence. Alford has stayed silent; however, her brother has shown open support for Kendrick,
            implying such rumors are untrue.

            The rappers also argue that the other is taking advantage of the Black community. Lamar attacks Drake&apos;s supposed insecurity of being biracial, saying that Drake tries to pretend his upbringing was harsher than it was. Lamar states that he is uncomfortable with Drake using the n-word
            because the latter is not “Black enough” to use the term. Meanwhile, Drake says Lamar&apos;s activism for the Black community is fake and he has not actually given back to the community. However, the general consensus is that Drake&apos;s claim is false, as Lamar has been known to
            consistently support Black communities financially and through activist efforts.

            Additionally, a security guard outside Drake&apos;s house was recently attacked in a drive-by shooting. While it is currently unclear what the reason for the shooting could have been, it may have been in response to the feud. This marks a severe escalation of the rappers&apos; dispute,
            to the point of serious harm.

            <br />
            Some suspect the feud as a whole is a publicity stunt, and it has clearly become entertainment for most. The rappers themselves are certainly aware of our enjoyment, as they are releasing music to maximize their listeners&apos; engagement. However, it is important to acknowledge the
            weaponization of abuse in this situation and consider the validity of Drake's and Kendrick Lamar&apos;s claims alike.
