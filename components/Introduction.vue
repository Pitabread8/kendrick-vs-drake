            For the first half of 2024, the hip-hop scene was ablaze as music lovers devoured the beef between rappers Kendrick Lamar and Drake. The two feuded for over 7 months, intermittently exchanging diss tracks and attacking each other&apos;s rapping skills, friends, and masculinity. The
            rivalry even pulled in Lamar&apos;s and Drake&apos;s frequent collaborators, who came out with a host of their own tracks. Though, in the end, neither rapper&apos;s career has changed much, the beef is sure to have a lasting impact on the music industry—for better or worse.

            Kendrick Lamar and Drake have a long history together. They have previously collaborated on a few tracks, notably “Buried Alive Interlude” (2011) and “Poetic Justice” (2012). In 2013, Big Sean came out with “Control” featuring Kendrick Lamar, who raps, “I got love for you all but
            I&apos;m tryna murder you” after naming several of his previous collaborators. The implication is that Lamar would soon be rising above his fellow rappers. Drake seemed to respond with “The Language” and publicly stated
            <a href="https://genius.com/a/a-history-of-drake-kendrick-lamars-subliminal-war" class="text-black underline">he didn&apos;t think much of Lamar&apos;s verse</a>. They would go back and forth over the next ten years, sprinkling their albums with sneak disses.

            In 2018, another beef between several rappers, including Drake, culminated in Pusha T revealing Drake&apos;s secret, now 6-year-old son in “The Story of Adidon.” Kendrick Lamar referenced this incident in May 2024 with “6:16 in LA” and “Meet the Grahams,” claiming Drake is hiding another
            child, a young girl.
